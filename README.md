# IT19A-B-AI
This is a Github Repo for the AI class for the IT19 A and IT19 B year @ HWR Berlin.
All presentations can be found in the Moodle Course belonging to this Repo.
It should provide some more contents on the shown code examples from the lecture and also some help/solutions proposal for the exercises done during the class.

For the exercises during the class, there are different levels of help:
    -   Stage 1: Only general comments on what to do__
    -   Stage 2: Defined methods and some more context on their functionality__
    -   Stage 3: Added some of the most difficult parts__
    -   Solution: A (hopefully) working example __
The Data will be included in the Repo as well, but can be found on the Internet as well. 
If name includes "short", this means, that it is just a small piece of the original file for better computing time and memory usage.
With full data set, it may happen, that your PC will crash or Python won't be able to comoute it.

For the content, that was shown in the presentation:
    -   You will have in an extra file __
    -   They were created with Jupiter Notebook (see https://jupyter.org/) and therefore you can find the line numbers from the presentation in these files__
    -   Some imports will be included several times for the reason of taking a screenshot for the presentation, but it is not necessary to do this for funcionality__
    -   They will be named with the number of the lecture we have__
    -   Some lectures may will have some extra content for understanding in an additional file__ 

Solutions from the students may be added as well if wished.
