#Student Challenge

This section will contain some datasets for the students to try out themselve freely and without any help.
It will be done in a way of a challenge, where every student or a group of students can tackle a dataset and try to solve the problem.
It is not necessary to participate into this challenge, it is just a possibility to work on an open topic and to present what has been achieved at the end of the course.

The challenge can be found in the folders with a short description. 
All datasets are taken from www.kaggle.com
