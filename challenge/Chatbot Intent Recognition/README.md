This dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/elvinagammed/chatbots-intent-recognition-dataset

In this challenge, it is requested to build a small chatbot-like program, that will be able to discover the Intents of a users input.
The intent classes are included in the JSON File as well as some example User Input.

To check, if the program works, a user should be able to write a text, that will be put into the correct intent class by the chatbot.
A bonus is to give back a correct answer as well, which are included in the dataset as well.
